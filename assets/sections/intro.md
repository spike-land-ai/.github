spike-land-ai is an AI-native development platform built across 15 independent repos — from a Next.js 16 main platform with 455+ MCP tools and Stripe-backed payments, to a from-scratch React Fiber implementation, edge transpilation workers, and a growing MCP ecosystem. It spans browser, edge (Cloudflare Workers), and server runtimes, all published under `@spike-land-ai` on GitHub Packages with automated dependency cascade CI.
